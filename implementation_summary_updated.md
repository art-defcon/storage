# Implementation Summary: Segmentation Visualization Enhancements

I've successfully implemented the requested improvements to the segmentation visualization in `utils.py`. Here's a summary of the changes made:

## 1. Relative Line Size

✅ **Implemented**: Border lines now scale with image size (0.3% of image width, minimum 1px)

- Added a new `calculate_line_width` function that calculates the line width as 0.3% of the image width with a minimum of 1px
- Applied this relative line width to:
  - Storage unit contour borders
  - Compartment contour borders
  - Fallback bounding boxes when masks aren't available

## 2. Enhanced Smoothing

✅ **Implemented**: Improved smoothing with rounded corners

- Added a new `chaikin_corner_cutting` function that implements Chaikin's algorithm with 3 iterations
- Enhanced the `smooth_contour` function to:
  - Use a higher epsilon factor (0.02 instead of 0.005) for more aggressive point reduction
  - Apply Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm to create rounded corners
- Applied this enhanced smoothing to both storage unit and compartment contours

## Key Code Changes

1. **Added New Helper Functions**:
   ```python
   def calculate_line_width(image_width, factor=0.003, min_width=1):
       """Calculate line width as a percentage of image width."""
       return max(min_width, int(image_width * factor))

   def chaikin_corner_cutting(points, iterations=3):
       """Apply Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm for smooth curves with rounded corners."""
       # Implementation of the algorithm
   ```

2. **Enhanced Smoothing Function**:
   ```python
   def smooth_contour(contour, epsilon_factor=0.02, apply_chaikin=True, chaikin_iterations=3):
       """Smooth a contour using Douglas-Peucker algorithm and Chaikin's corner cutting."""
       # Enhanced implementation with both algorithms
   ```

3. **Modified Visualization Function**:
   - Added line width calculation: `line_width = calculate_line_width(image.shape[1])`
   - Updated contour drawing to use the calculated line width and enhanced smoothing
   - Applied the same changes to both storage unit and compartment contours

## Expected Results

The implementation should now provide:

1. **Proportional Border Lines**: Lines that scale with image size, ensuring consistent visual appearance across different image resolutions
2. **Smoother Contours**: Reduced number of vector points for cleaner segmentation outlines
3. **Rounded Corners**: Elimination of sharp angles for a more natural and polished appearance
4. **More Professional Visualization**: Overall improved aesthetic quality of the segmentation visualization

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the improvements:

1. Test with various image sizes to ensure the line width scales appropriately
2. Compare the smoothing results with the previous implementation
3. Check that the contours have fewer points and smoother, rounded corners
